Playing around with some linear algebra.

Things to read up to understand the code:

- [Inverse trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions)
- [Line-line intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection)
- [Parametrized segment intersection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/563198/how-do-you-detect-where-two-line-segments-intersect/565282#565282)

Based on https://github.com/ncase/sight-and-light.
